Brief Description:


I installed all the necessary dependecies and imported all the required libraries.
I set up my bottom tab navigator in app.js using react-navigation and also created a tab navigator.
I then created individual screens in my components folder and 
added theme toggle functionality in my settings to affect the theme in both the home screen and settings screen.
